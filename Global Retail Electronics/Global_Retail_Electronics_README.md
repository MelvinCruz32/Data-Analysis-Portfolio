# Global Retail Electronics

## Overview
This project analyzes the global retail electronics trends such as customer location, products, revenue, order quantity, average delivery days, and average order value.
## Objective
- What types of products does the company sell, and where are customers located?
- Are there any seasonal patterns or trends for order volume or revenue?
- How long is the average delivery time in days? Has that changed over time?
- Is there a difference in average order value (AOV) for online vs. in-store sales?
## Tools Used
- Python
- Tableau
## Process
### 1. Data Collection
- This dataset is from the Maven Analytics data playground (https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?page=2&pageSize=5).
- It includes tables such as Sales, Products, Customers, Stores, and Exchange Rates.
### 2. Data Cleaning
- I checked for duplicates, but none of the tables had any.
- I standardized data types for each column in each table.
- I created a "Store Type" column for the sales table. This column indicates if purchases are made in-store or online.
- The sales table's delivery date column had null values, so I used the backfill function to fill in that column.
